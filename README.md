## About this Repository

### Linear Regression Cost Function
The cost function of Linear regression is given as:

### Parameter Update
The parameter(s) theta, are updated with the equation below. 
<br/>
Notice that alpha is the learning rate/step size.

### Vectorization
The equations can be vectorized and implemented as matrices.

### Plotting Cost against Number of Iterations
<br/>
<br/>

This is an effective tool for debugging an algorithm. 
<br/>
The cost MUST go down over the number of increasing iterations.

### Normal Equation Method
This method is an alternative to regression, and solves for the parameters directly.
